                    Last decade's predominant model was 'desktop software', each with a native user interfaces written from scratch.  Software of this sort often needed
                    to be substantially rewritten in order to make the software usable on both Mac and Windows, with other subsequent rewrites for Linux and other operating
                    systems. The modern answer to this maintenance morass is the web-based application with a  browser-based interface,
                    with all its attendant advantages in terms of flexibility, scalability, maintainability and much else. Early browser-based interfaces suffered, however,
                    because browser-based graphics could not measure up to their native desktop counterparts. With the recent explosion in JavaScript-based graphics, however,
                    and especially with the spread of SVG, HTML5, CSS3, and graphics meta-packages such as D3, a purely browser-based interface can now rival almost anything
                    available in a desktop UI.  Web-based applications can only proliferate slowly, however, if software engineers
                    all work independently and fail to leverage one another's work. The goal of this project is offer a alternative approach that emphasizes
                    code reuse at least at least with regard to the graphical aspects of user interfaces.
